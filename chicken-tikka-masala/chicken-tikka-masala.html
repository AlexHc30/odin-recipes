        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A classic curry-stand recipe. This is not haute cuisine; this is the kind of nuclear-orange tikka masala that you crave when you stumble out of a pub at 2 a.m. I also added much more cayenne pepper than 1 teaspoon, but I give out the recipe like this for people who don't like heat.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)</li>
            <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon curry powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat ghee in a large skillet over medium heat and cook and stir onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook and stir just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir cumin, 1 teaspoon salt, ginger, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, and turmeric into the onion mixture; fry until fragrant, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir tomato sauce into the onion and spice mixture, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Simmer sauce for 10 minutes, then mix in cream, paprika, and 1 tablespoon sugar. Bring sauce back to a simmer and cook, stirring often, until sauce is thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a separate skillet over medium heat. Stir chicken into the hot oil, sprinkle with curry powder, and sear chicken until lightly browned but still pink inside, about 3 minutes; stir often. Transfer chicken and any pan juices into the sauce. Simmer chicken in sauce until no longer pink, about 30 minutes; adjust salt and sugar to taste.</li>
        </ol>
