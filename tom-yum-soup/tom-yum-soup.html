        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>At first sip of this Thai tom yum soup, you'll be overcome by the intoxicating flavors of lemongrass, garlic, lime, coconut milk, and chile combined with a chicken stock base and topped off with shrimp. If you like spice, we recommend either fresh red chiles or getting yourself a bottle of chile oil and adding anywhere from a few drops to a few teaspoons. Or leave the chile out for a terrific mild tom yum.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>1 cup cherry tomatoes, sliced in half</li>
            <li>1/4 to 1/3 (13.5-ounce) can coconut milk</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Pour the stock into a deep cooking pot over medium-high heat. Add the prepared lemongrass, including the upper sections of the stalk you didn't mince. Boil 5 to 6 minutes to soften.</li>
            <li>Add carrot, garlic, onion, galangal or ginger, lime leaves, 1 1/2 tablespoons of the fish sauce, soy sauce, and lime juice. Reduce heat slightly, cover, and continue simmering 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and zucchini, and continue simmering another 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Add shrimp and cherry tomatoes. Cook 3 minutes or until shrimp are pink and plump.</li>
            <li>Turn down the heat to low and add 1/4 can coconut milk, chile oil, and brown sugar and red pepper flakes to taste (if using). Add the remaining teaspoon of fish sauce or more chile oil to taste. Discard the lime or bay leaves and the zest, if using. Serve with fresh cilantro sprinkled over and enjoy. </li>
        </ol>
