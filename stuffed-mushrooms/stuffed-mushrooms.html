        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These delicious mushrooms taste just like restaurant-style stuffed mushrooms and are my girl's favorites.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>12 whole fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Clean mushrooms with a damp paper towel. Carefully break off stems. Chop stems extremely fine, discarding tough end of stems.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and chopped mushroom stems to the skillet. Fry until any moisture has disappeared, taking care not to burn garlic. Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>When garlic and mushroom mixture is no longer hot, stir in cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, black pepper, onion powder and cayenne pepper. Mixture should be very thick. Using a little spoon, fill each mushroom cap with a generous amount of stuffing. Arrange the mushroom caps on prepared cookie sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the mushrooms are piping hot and liquid starts to form under caps.</li>
        </ol>
